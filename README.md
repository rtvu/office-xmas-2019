# PuzzleChallenge

PuzzleChallenge is a treasure hunt game where users interact with real world objects to complete game objectives.

The staged area have items that contain invisible digital watermarks generated by HP Link. Using the HP Link app, triggering a digital watermark will direct the user to the PuzzleChallenge webpage with updates to the user's progress.
